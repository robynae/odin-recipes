          <h2>Cooking instructions: </h2>
            <p>A quick note: <strong>make sure you are using cheese that you grate <em>yourself</em></strong>
            - pre-shredded cheese has a coating on it that prevents proper melting.</p>
          <h3>Alright, let's get into it! For the noodles:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions">
              <li>Bring chicken stock to a boil, flavor it further with Better than Bouillon</li>
              <li>Boil mac and cheese until tender, you still want some bite to it, as it will be baked later</li>
              <li>Drain the mac and cheese once cooked</li>
              <li>Melt a stick of butter into the noodles</li>
              <li>Set aside until ready to assemnle</li>
            </ol>
          <h3>For the cheese sauce:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions">
              <li>Melt your butter in a large, oven=proof pot. I prefer an enameled dutch oven</li>
              <li>Once butter is melted, whisk in your flour. Whisk constantly until the flour has incorporated, and for one additional minute to get rid of raw glour taste</li>
              <li>Slowly pour in your milk and heavy whipping cream, stirring constantly until everything is mixed together</li>
              <li>Add in your spices and hot sauce- salt can wait until the end but I still always add some in this step</li>
              <li>Let sit on medium heat, stirring frequently until the mixture evenly coats the back of a spoon. Then remove off heat</li>
              <li>Add in cream cheese, stur until melted</li>
              <li>Add in the rest of your cheese, stir until creamy and melted</li>
              <li>Add in your teaspoon or 2 of sweetened condensed milk- trust me</li>
              <li>Stir in your cooked noodles</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Baking instructions: </h3>
              <ol class="instructions">
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees</li>
                <li>Cover your mac and cheese with the cheddar cheese you set aside earlier</li>
                <li>Once oven is preheated, bake mac and cheese for about 30 minutes, until the cheese turns brown and bubbly</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
