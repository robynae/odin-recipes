# odin-recipes

This is the first project for The Odin Project, where I will be creating a webpage of recipes. The skills that I am to demonstrate for this project are as follows:

-use of the command line through creating and navigating files

-Git workflow by staging and committing changes and adding (hopefully) clear commit messages

-basic grasp of HTML syntax by adding text, images, lists (both ordered and unordered), and links to other webpages from the same directory

Thank you for reading my very first project!
